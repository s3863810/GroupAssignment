		<p><br>Born and raised in the south of Adelaide, South Australia, I currently reside on a farm roughly 1.5 hrs south of the city. I have had an interset in IT for many years but am only now seeking to pursue it further. I am married with two children, and spend my limited free time either with them or reading; science fiction, philosophy, economic and political theory are my current reading interests.</p></span>

		<p><br>I was born in Mildura Victoria and moved here to Darwin Northern Territory 20 years ago. The weather here is much different than Mildura. Mildura has four seasons, autumn, winter, spring, summer; here in Darwin there are only two seasons, wet or dry. During the wet season we can receive up to 2 metres of rain over the six months.</p>
		<p>When I was 23 years old, I lived and worked on a farm outside Rome Italy, in a town called Albano Lazziale. I attended night school language classes there and learnt to speak a small amount of Italian. The class had people from all around Europe, not one of us could speak the same language, the only way for us to communicate to each other was to speak in Italian. Do you remember the old comedy TV show “Welcome back Kotter” with John Travolta? Their class was made up from students with different nationalities and most of them couldn’t speak English. That is how I compared our Italian language classes.</p>
		<p>I have completed various studies during my working life, Advanced Diploma Health and Safety, Advanced Diploma Surface Mining, Western Australian Unrestricted Quarry Managers Certificate, and recently the Associate Degree in Engineering.</p></span>

		<p><br>Based in Melbourne and currently working as a freelance filmmaker. I mostly work in post-production, having edited a range of short films, documentaries, music videos and commercials. I also do some animation, motion graphics, visual effects and design.</p>
		<p>In my spare time, I love going to the cinemas, watching sport, listening to music and playing futsal. When I've had the chance, I've also enjoyed solo travel around the world and am very keen to return to Norway sometime in the future.</p>
		<p>In high school I loved IT and in the past year or so I've reignited my interest. Previously I've had experience with web design but have been teaching myself Python just for fun, as well as playing around with my Raspberry Pi. At the moment, I'm aiming for a career in programming but am just trying to broaden my knowledge in the entire field before finding what bests suits me.</p></span>

		<p><br>Born and raised in Pakistan, I migrated to Australia after getting married. After settling here, I decided to pursue my studies in business once more, as I enjoy studying and learning new things. I also love reading stories, mainly fiction and fantasy, and I enjoy playing video games.</p>
		<p>While I am a student of business studies and accounting mainly, the more of programming I study, the more interesting it seems to me. Most of it generates from the fact that I enjoy playing video games, so learning about the inner workings of how such programs are written is very interesting.</p>
		<p>This is my first subject studying anything IT related, as most of my IT experience is limited to games and using the internet for a variety of things. As such I don't have any technical IT experience, however in today's world, IT covers a broad spectrum of fields and one way or another, you'll end up gaining exposure to IT.</p></span>
