			<h3>Industry Data</h3>
			<p>An analysis of our team’s ideal jobs and skill sets has been made against the supplied Burning Glass data (Burning Glass Technologies 2018). We have produced three tables that list job title rankings, IT specific skill sets and general skill sets.  The team data is represented using charts and Venn diagrams in order to better understand relationships between team members and their respective skills sets. Additionally, this provides context relating to industry demand within the supplied data framework. </p>
