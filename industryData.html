			<h3>Industry Data</h3>
			<p>An analysis of our team’s ideal jobs and skill sets has been made against the supplied Burning Glass data (Burning Glass Technologies 2018). We have produced three tables that list job title rankings, IT specific skill sets and general skill sets. The team has represented the data using charts and Venn diagrams in order to better understand relationships between team members and their respective skills sets. Additionally, this provides context relating to industry demand within the supplied data framework. </p>

    <h4>Burning Glass Job Title Rankings</h4>
    <p>The team identified the relevant Burning Glass occupation titles and rankings (Burning Glass Technologies 2018) which correspond to each team member’s ideal job. There are three team members in the top five Burning Glass occupations: Chris and Eleni are ranked in first place as python/django and cloud developers respectively. John’s ideal role as a senior system administrator places him at number four in the list. Ben and Romaisa are ranked in the middle - with Ben’s ideal role as a cyber security analyst placing him in thirteenth position and Romaisa’s role as an IT Trainer placing her in sixteenth position. All our team member’s ideal roles are ranked in the top twenty Burning Glass occupations demonstrating a high overall industry demand for all our occupations.

    <h4>Group IT Specific Skill Set</h4>
    <p>An analysis of the ideal job advertisement requirements and Burning Glass specialised skills data (Burning Glass Technologies 2018) was conducted to collate the team’s IT specific skill set requirements for each occupation. These skills were ranked and a group skill set table was produced.  A Venn diagram visualisation of this table is shown to the right, along with data tables of the group required skill set and the top three skills outside of the groups skill set. 
<br> <br>
Our team’s required skill set is in high demand and ranked across seven of the top ten skills and fourteen of the overall top twenty five skills.  Whilst many IT skills are highly specific to individual occupations, our team has an overlap across broader, transferable IT skills such as: Technical Support, Building Relationships and Customer Support. This is also the case with the software development roles where high level skills such as Git version control can be used across different, highly specific, software engineering roles. The non group IT skills represent two highly specific skills: Java and SAP which are particular to development roles. However, the Business Management skill is a higher level IT skill which all team members could potentially benefit from by developing this skill as it is transferable across different IT occupations.
