			<h3>Ideal Jobs</h3>
			<p>While all our individual members have different goals, dreams and interests and as a result, have
						different ideal jobs, there are a few similarities between all jobs. Now it is obvious to note
						that they are related to Information Technology in some way, however, IT is vast field covering
						a variety of different fields; the skills needed for one job may be completely different to that
						of another. However, it should be noted that working with a team is a highly valued skill found
						in many of the jobs. In today’s world, IT specialists rarely work alone, and for this reason
						being a team player is a valuable skill and is listed in the requirements in many jobs. Some of
						the jobs cover security, albeit in different ways such as setting up firewalls or being a cyber
						security analyst, which is broader. Many jobs will require interacting with code in some way,
						either directly by being asked to write it, or indirectly, by being asked to teach about it and
						making user guides. One of the jobs required an understanding of finance and accounting; this is
						proof that not only does IT cover a vast spectrum of fields, it is also essential in many fields
						today that were unrelated to IT in the past.</p>

						Team One’s ideal jobs span the gamut of the IT landscape.<br>
						We have two software developers: Chris focusing on web application development and myself as a
						cloud software developer.
						These represent some of the most in demand occupations and skill sets according to Burning
						Glass.<br><br>
						John’s ideal role as senior systems administrator represents another in demand job and an
						expansion into management, planning and analysis.<br><br>
						Romaisa’s role as an IT Trainer requires the top baseline skills. These include: communication
						skills, writing, planning, and teamwork.
						The success of this role lies in highly developed IT soft skills.<br><br>
						Ben’s role as a cyber security analyst is another role, along with John and Romaisa, requires
						analytical, planning and communication skills,
						in addition to specific IT skills in networking, system administration and software testing.<br><br>
						All roles require proficient soft skills such as problem solving, teamwork and communication
						skills. Soft skills are an integral part of any IT role today (Doyle 2019).
						The specific IT skills vary depending on the role, as they each have highly specific
						requirements.

					<h4>Romaisa</h4>
					<p>Information Technology is involved in a massive number of industries in today’s day and age.
						Naturally all our jobs would be related to IT in some way; it’ll be harder to find jobs that don’t involve IT.
						My ideal job is more on the mentoring side, involved in hosting webinars and creating user guides for systems useful in finance and accounts. My ideal job differs from my group members because it also values knowledge of finance and accounts. At the same time, my ideal job is similar to other members because it requires teamwork, which is a highly valued skill in today’s age.
						In fact, most of our jobs require teamwork in some capacity, but otherwise involve different fields of IT, such as security and programming.</p>
