			<h3>Ideal Jobs</h3>
			<p>While all our individual members have different goals, dreams and interests and as a result, have
						different ideal jobs, there are a few similarities between all jobs. Now it is obvious to note
						that they are related to Information Technology in some way, however, IT is vast field covering
						a variety of different fields; the skills needed for one job may be completely different to that
						of another. However, it should be noted that working with a team is a highly valued skill found
						in many of the jobs. In todayâ€™s world, IT specialists rarely work alone, and for this reason
						being a team player is a valuable skill and is listed in the requirements in many jobs. Some of
						the jobs cover security, albeit in different ways such as setting up firewalls or being a cyber
						security analyst, which is broader. Many jobs will require interacting with code in some way,
						either directly by being asked to write it, or indirectly, by being asked to teach about it and
						making user guides. One of the jobs required an understanding of finance and accounting; this is
						proof that not only does IT cover a vast spectrum of fields, it is also essential in many fields
						today that were unrelated to IT in the past.</p>
