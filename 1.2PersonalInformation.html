	<p><br>I was born in Mildura Victoria and moved here to Darwin Northern Territory 20 years ago. The weather here is much different than Mildura. Mildura has four seasons, autumn,<br/>
	winter, spring, summer; here in Darwin there are only two seasons, wet or dry. During the wet season we can receive up to 2 metres of rain over the six months.<br/>
	When I was 23 years old, I lived and worked on a farm outside Rome Italy, in a town called Albano Lazziale. I attended night school language classes there and learnt<br/>
	to speak a small amount of Italian. The class had people from all around Europe, not one of us could speak the same language, the only way for us to communicate to each<br/>
	other was to speak in Italian. Do you remember the old comedy TV show “Welcome back Kotter” with John Travolta? Their class was made up from students with different nationalities<br/>
	and most of them couldn’t speak English. That is how I compared our Italian language classes.<br/>
	I have completed various studies during my working life, Advanced Diploma Health and Safety, Advanced Diploma Surface Mining, Western Australian Unrestricted Quarry Managers Certificate,<br/>
	and recently the Associate Degree in Engineering.</p>
