			<p>The common interest we all have in our ideal job is that we are all interested in Information Technology. The common element of these jobs is communication and positive interactions with internal and external stakeholders. There are a lot of difference between each team members career path from training, engineering, administration, developer to security.</p>

			<p>While all our individual members have different goals, dreams and interests and as a result, have different ideal jobs, there are a few similarities between all jobs. Now it is obvious to note that they are related to Information Technology in some way, however, IT is vast field covering a variety of different fields; the skills needed for one job may be completely different to that of another. However, it should be noted that working with a team is a highly valued skill found in many of the jobs. In todayâ€™s world, IT specialists rarely work alone, and for this reason being a team player is a valuable skill and is listed in the requirements in many jobs. Some of the jobs cover security, albeit in different ways such as setting up firewalls or being a cyber security analyst, which is broader. Many jobs will require interacting with code in some way, either directly by being asked to write it, or indirectly, by being asked to teach about it and making user guides. One of the jobs required an understanding of finance and accounting; this is proof that not only does IT cover a vast spectrum of fields, it is also essential in many fields today that were unrelated to IT in the past.</p>
