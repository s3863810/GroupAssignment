			<p>My understanding of how this information may be helpful to the group is how we interact as a group.  The Myers-Briggs test results showed that the majority of our group are introverted, intuitive and feeling and our Big 5 results show that we are open and agreeable.  There maybe some miscommunications during the project, but overall we should work well as a team.</p>

			<p>Comparison of our tests yielded some interesting observations; firstly, while most of us were introverted, the person who we nominated for leader leaned towards being extraverted, orderly, organised and planned. It was a natural process – the ‘leader’ was taking charge by asking us to provide the necessary information and scheduling meeting times and this was recognised by the other team members. Secondly, test results are able to somewhat accurately predict the different roles and tasks the group members prefer, as well as their working styles. People who are lean towards visual or auditory learning asked questions about their tasks, while people with a more tactile approach preferred to do the work first then showcase it and ask for feedback. Tests might not be a fully accurate representation of everyone’s personalities and working styles, however, they do provide some basic insights as to how people will interact within a group. For example, people with assertive traits usually make decisions or suggest decisions, while people naturally think of the person who organises meetings and delegates tasks as a ‘leader’. Of course, regarding our group, most of us have some traits that are common (such as being introverted), and similar personalities usually get along with each other.</p>
