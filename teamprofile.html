			<p>Our individual test results show a wide range of personality types and strengths, with most team members showing a propensity to be able to engage effectively in a team environment even if they prefer working alone. While we have several members who do prefer to work alone, as shown by their Introversion scores, this is nicely balanced by a few members who score higher on introversion. Without individuals willing to put themselves, or more importantly, their ideas out there, a group can stagnate and stall with no clear direction.</p>
			<p>The main downside of this is our group will need to work hard to ensure quieter members and their ideas are not overlooked or steamrolled. Ideally team members would be able to self-identify any issues such as this, but occasionally other team members, even those uncomfortable with it, will have to step in to ensure an equal discussion is taking place.</p>

			<p>Comparison of our tests yielded some interesting observations; firstly, while most of us were introverted, the person who we nominated for leader leaned towards being extraverted, orderly, organised and planned. It was a natural process – the ‘leader’ was taking charge by asking us to provide the necessary information and scheduling meeting times and this was recognised by the other team members. Secondly, test results are able to somewhat accurately predict the different roles and tasks the group members prefer, as well as their working styles. People who are lean towards visual or auditory learning asked questions about their tasks, while people with a more tactile approach preferred to do the work first then showcase it and ask for feedback. Tests might not be a fully accurate representation of everyone’s personalities and working styles, however, they do provide some basic insights as to how people will interact within a group. For example, people with assertive traits usually make decisions or suggest decisions, while people naturally think of the person who organises meetings and delegates tasks as a ‘leader’. Of course, regarding our group, most of us have some traits that are common (such as being introverted), and similar personalities usually get along with each other.</p>

			<p>Based on the findings of the tests, John was viewed as the logical choice as a leader. His results suggested that he would be a selfless, reliable and tolerant leader, in addition to him being extroverted in a group largely composed of introverted individuals. This has been reflected in how he has maintained organization and team cohesion.</p>
			<p>Creativity, honesty, and openness were all traits shared amongst Ben, Romaisa, and I. This allowed us to find new approaches to our work and find the best possible solution. Meanwhile, Eleni's quick thinking capabilities have been on display in her consistently on-time delivery at a high level. The group has worked well dynamically and while these tests are only guides, they did provide an insight into how roles could be effectively assigned.</p>

			<p>I found the test results interesting, especially the Myers Briggs Tests, as they indicate that three out of the five team members are introverts. With remote communication, this could prove to be a barrier that we need to mindful of as a group to ensure there is a forum that is easy for team members to open up and communicate with each other. Our learning styles are diverse, spanning auditory, visual and kinesthetic learners. I see this as advantageous to the group, as the assignments call for the utilisation of varied learning approaches in the delivery of different aspects of the project. This allows members to naturally gravitate across areas that are intuitive to their individual learning styles.</p>

			<h4>John</h4>
			<p>My understanding of how this information may be helpful to the group is how we interact as a group.  The Myers-Briggs test results showed that the majority of our group are introverted, intuitive and feeling and our Big 5 results show that we are open and agreeable.  There maybe some miscommunications during the project, but overall we should work well as a team.</p>
